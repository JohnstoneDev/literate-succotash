## YouTube to WAV Frequently Asked Questions
### What is the WAV format?
The Wave Audio File Format is an audio file format that contains uncompressed audio. It was developed by Microsoft and IBM as the Windows default format for raw audio. It's also known as WAV due to its filename extension, and it was released in 1991.
### Is the WAV format better than MP3?
WAV is much better than MP3 in terms of quality. Since WAV is an uncompressed format, the audio files sound as close to the original as possible. On the other hand, MP3 uses lossy compression, so sound reproduction is not the most accurate. That's why WAV sounds up to 10 times better than MP3.
However, MP3 offers smaller file sizes than WAV and is universally supported.

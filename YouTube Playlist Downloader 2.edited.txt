##Why Download Videos from YouTube?
Some may believe YouTube is the best platform for free entertainment and listening to music. Such an assumption is not without basis. YouTube hosts countless videos, the vast majority of which are available to all users. However, it has some flaws, like constantly interrupting videos with ads.
You can highly improve your experience with YouTube content by downloading the videos due to the following reasons: 
* Once you download the videos, you don't have to endure ads anymore. 
* You no longer depend on an Internet connection anymore to enjoy your videos. So you can watch the videos whenever you want because they're fully downloaded on your device.
* Since the videos are fully downloaded, you don't have to deal with lag in case your connection is somehow unstable or slow.
